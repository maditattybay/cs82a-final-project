# CS82A Final Project – COVID-19 Data Analysis

This repository contains the final project for **CS 82A: Intro to Data Science**
at **Santa Monica College**.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze a public COVID-19 dataset,
perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, visualization,
and apply a simple machine learning model to study trends in reported cases.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle:

**US Counties COVID-19 Daily Dataset**

It contains daily reported COVID-19 cases and deaths
for counties across the United States and is maintained by
*The New York Times*.

The dataset is not included in this repository due to file size limitations.
It can be downloaded directly from Kaggle:

## Methods Used
- Data preprocessing and cleaning (Pandas)
- Exploratory data analysis
- Data visualization (Matplotlib)
- Linear regression modeling (scikit-learn)
